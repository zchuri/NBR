\description{
A dataset containing the functional connectivity between
16 brain areas of 32 prairie voles in three different sessions.
}
\details{
Data is based on an experiment of social bonding in prairie voles.
Functional connectivity was measured as the Pearson correlation
between the average fMRI signal from the regions of interest (ROI)
within 16 anatomical areas of brain. Then, a total of
120 pairwise connections are contained in the dataset.
NOTE: This is not the original data of the study!
